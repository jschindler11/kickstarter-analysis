# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to use data from previous campaigns to inform Louise about her own fundraising campaign.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Determined theater outcomes based on launch date (month). Filtered and only used outcomes of successful, failed, and canceled.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Determined play outcomes based on the $goal of the campaign (in ranges of 5,000). 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
When creating my Outcomes Based on Goals chart, to get the y axis values to be percentages, I had to change the column from 'general' to 'percentages'
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1) The month of the launch date for a theater campaign has no corrolation with whether or not the campaign will be canceled.
2) The summer (and specifically May-July) is the best time to launch a theater campaign. These months have had the most successful campaigns.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1) 92% (961/1043) of play campaigns had a goal less than $15,000. For these campaigns, the percentage of successful campaigns decreases as the campaign goals increase and the percentage of failed campaigns increases as the campaign goal increases. As $goal of a campaign increases, the success of the campaign decreases, for campaigns with $goals up to $15,000. Only 8% of all play campaigns had a $goal over $15,000, and there is no corrolation between $goal amount and success of a campaign when the $goal is over $15,000.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1) Success of a campaign means that the $ pledged is greater than the $ goal, but what if the $ goal was not large enough to start with?
2) We have no idea about the methods of funding...maybe a campaign didn't meet it's $ goal because outreach was poor, not that the idea for the campaign itself was poor.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1) Box and Whisker plot for both goal and pledged to find potential outliers
2) Outcomes based on length of campaign
